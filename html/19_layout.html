        <p>Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or a newspaper).</p>
        <h1>Layout Elements</h1>
        <p>HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page</p>
        <img src="src/layout.png">
        <p>There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CSS framwork</li>
            <li>CSS float property</li>
            <li>CSS flexbox</li>
            <li>CSS grid</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>CSS framework</h2>
        <p>You can use a framework like bootstrap or w3.css.</p>
        <h2>CSS Float Layout</h2>
        <p>It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter.</p>
        <h2>CSS flexbox layout</h2>
        <p>Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.</p>
        <h2>CSS grid layout</h2>
        <p>The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.</p>
