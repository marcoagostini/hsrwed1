<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more! CSS can be used with html in three ways: inline, internal and external.<br>
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements<br>
Internal - by using a style element in the head section<br>
External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</p>

<h1>Inline CSS</h1>
<h4 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h4>
<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

<h1>Internal CSS</h1>
An internal CSS is defined in the head section of an HTML page, within a style element.
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h4   {color: blue;
}
p    {color: red;
}
</style>
<h4>This is a heading</h4>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<h1>External CSS</h1>
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages. To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the head section of each HTML page. The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.
