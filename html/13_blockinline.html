        <p>Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
        There are two display values: block and inline.</p>
        <h1>Block-level elements</h1>
            <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.</p>
            <div>Hello World</div>
        <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
            <p>An inline element does not start on a new line.An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. This is a span element inside a paragraph -> <span>(Hello World)</span>.</p>
        <h1>The div Element</h1>
            <p>The div element is often used as a container for other html elements. It has no required attributes but style, cass and id are common. When used together with css the div element can be used to style blocks of content.</p>
        <div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
        <h2>London</h2>
            <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>The span element</h1>
        <p>The span element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text or a part of a document. When used with css the span element can be used to stoyle parts of the text.</p>
